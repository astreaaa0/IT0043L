            <p>Jujutsu Kaisen is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It follows high school student Yuji Itadori as he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers to eliminate a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host.</p>

            <h2>Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 262 left fans disappointed, here's why it was so short</h2>
            <p>Jujutsu Kaisen previously revealed a twisted narrative as Yuta took over Gojo's dead body. Fans initially thought that Gojo was alive and thriving again, but those hopes were shattered by the shocking revelation about who was really in control of him. As the plot thickened, fans eagerly awaited the release of Chapter 262 in hopes of learning more about the gruelling fight against Sukuna.</p>

                <p>Yuta and Sukuna simultaneously expand their domains, trapping themselves inside a barrier as small as a sports ball in front of Yuji Itadori and Aoi Todo. The shrunken Unlimited Void was Satoru Gojo's solution to Sukuna's Malevolent Shrine, having been able to withstand the slashing attacks against its barrier from the outside for three minutes. Yuta was able to perform this feat by doing replacement training with Gojo to improve his barrier techniques, and he was confident he could defeat the exhausted Sukuna in three minutes like his sensei.</p>
